# How we are labelling chains

1. Search for the name of the hotel without the location, try to find a chain of that name
2. Search for the hotel with the location. Try to find a parent company or offerings for other locations
3. If no website can be found, assume not a chain

Labeling:
0 - Not a chain
1 - Chain
2 - Has a parent, but does not share a name
3 - Acquired with name change
